            <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
            <img class="salmon-img" src="images/salmonboatbeach.jpg" alt="Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho">
            <p>
                Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. 
                <br>The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the 
                <br>people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and 
                <br>fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                
               <br><br>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and 
               <br>bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with 
               <br>awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites 
               <br>and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
            
                <br><br>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one 
                <br>of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the 
                <br>water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and 
                <br>warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with 
                <br>children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

            <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
            <img class="havasu-img" src="images/havasu.jpg" alt="Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah">
            <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, 
                <br>the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey 
                <br>stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. 
                <br>This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) 
                <br>and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and 
                <br>historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.

            <br><br>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days

            <br><br>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  
            <br>This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

            <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
            <img class="sidecanyon" src="images/sidecanyon.jpg" alt="Grand Canyon, Arizona">
            <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. 
                <br>You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.

            <br><br>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking 
            <br>scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled 
            <br>not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and 
            <br>ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.

            <br><br>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. 
            <br>The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate 
            <br>such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are 
            <br>familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
