        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        A place photos of our different plants at different stages of growth. I want to have photos of the plants at different stages from tiny to big plants. I will have pictures of the way we plant them. I want to also include photos of us caring for the plants and also of transplanting them and separating the pups from the plants. I also want to include a short biography about our family and how we came to love aloe.

      </ul>
      <h3>Uses For Aloe</h3>
      <p>
        There will be a section where you can learn about the different uses for aloe as a plant and in other forms. There will be a way read about what you can use it for besides just burns. You can also use aloe for stomach health by ingesting it which can help with irritable bowel syndrome. You can add aloe to your toothpaste and it will help to improve oral health and helps to reduce plaque. Using fresh aloe on your face can help if you suffer from acne. It is also good to know that aloe is safe for most people. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and children under the age of 12, should avoid the oral use of aloe vera. I want to share how people can use aloe safely and the most effectively.

      <h3>Care of Plants</h3>
      <p>
        There will be a page explaining how we care for our plants and what we use to make sure that they grow as healthy as possible. I want to give points for how to make their plants thrive and grow healthy. I will share the type of soil that we use and the amount of water that we give our plants to make them thrive. I also want to share the amount of sunlight that the plants need. Aloes are very low-maintenance and I want to share with others how easy they are grown successfully.
