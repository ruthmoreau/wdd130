    <p>Hello everyone! I am Ruth Ann Moreau. I am a stay-at-home mom of
    four dauhters. I have been married to my husband for over 15 years.
    We currently live in Florida. We homeschool our children and enjoy
    doing things together as a family. </p>
    <p>I am currently getting my second family history certificate and want
    to get my Bachelor's degree in computers. I already have an Associate's 
    degree in computer science. I love computers and programming so I love 
    any opporotunity to learn more skills in the computer field. I am wanting 
    to use my computer skills to help build my own geneaology business.</p>

    were sealed in the Orlando, FL temple on our 11th wedding anniversary 
    with our three oldest daughter. Our youngest daughter was born 3 years
    after we were sealed.</p>
